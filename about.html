            <h2>Hi, I'm Jibbe</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! I'm Jibbe, a game design generalist from The Netherlands born in 2006, currently a student at Hanze University of Applied Sciences. I recently completed my first year of Creative Media and Game Technologies cum laude and I am currently striving to make more awesome games in year 2 of the programme.
                I have a wide range of skills across programming, 2D and 3D art, and game design, but my main forte is in programming.
                I love taking on challenges, learning new things and I always like to put some extra time in to refine my creations making sure that the creative vision is achieved in the best possible way. Whether it's writing code, making art assets, or designing game mechanics, I thrive on bringing a game to life.
                Here you can see some of the projects I have had the opportunity of contributing to, and feel free to get in touch if you'd like to collaborate or learn more about my work. =)
