                Revenge of the Renter is a serious stealth puzzle game designed to help the municipality of Groningen by making its residents more aware of the energy transition and giving them a sense of involvement in the process.
                Our approach focused on 18 to 30-year-olds who are most likely renting their homes.
                As renters, their ability to impact their living space is limited, so we concentrated on educating players about their rights as renters and informing them about landlords' responsibilities.
                The game empowers players to hold their landlords accountable and promotes sustainable living.
                I worked on this project from February 2024 to June 2024, dedicating about 15 weeks to its development.
                My role was primarily as a Programmer. Additionally, I took on a secondary role as a 3D artist, creating various models for the house.
                During this progress I learned to work with Unity, C#, and learned how to make textured 3D models.
                Our group received a grade of 10 and was honored with the title of 'Jury's Favorite' game among all Year 1 student games, awarded by a jury of industry professionals.
